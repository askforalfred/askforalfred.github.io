                        ALFRED (Action Learning From Realistic Environments and Directives), is a new benchmark for learning a mapping from natural language instructions and egocentric vision to sequences of actions for household tasks. Long composition rollouts with non-reversible state changes are among the phenomena we include to shrink the gap between research benchmarks and real-world applications.

            <h2>Getting Started with ALFRED</h2>
            <h3>Getting the Data</h3>
            <p>See <a href="https://github.com/askforalfred/alfred">this guide</a> for downloading the dataset, running models, and data-augmentation. Also see the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01734">paper</a> for a description of the challenge.</p>
            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <p>We use a model-agnostic evaluation process to measure the performance of your trained agent. See the guide for running a model on the test sets to create a JSON dump of action-sequences executed by the agent. These action-sequences are replayed on the leaderboard server to compute the performance metrics.</p>
            <p>We will report the following metrics:</p>
            <h4>Seen and Unseen Splits (separate)</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>success_rate:</strong> overall task goal completion</li>
                <li><strong>path_length_weighted_success_rate:</strong> overall task goal completion weighted by the number of steps in the gold trajectory</li>
                <li><strong>postcondition_success_rate:</strong> number of partial goal conditions completed by the agent</li>
                <li><strong>path_length_weighted_postcondition_success_rate:</strong> number of partial goal conditions completed weighted by the number of steps taken in the gold trajectory</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Predictions Format</h3>
            <p>Run your model on test seen and unseen sets, and create an action-sequence dump of your agent:</p>
            <p><code>$ python models/eval/leaderboard.py --model_path &lt;model_path&gt;/best_seen.pth --model models.model.seq2seq_im_mask --data data/json_feat_2.1.0 --gpu --num_threads 5</code></p>
            <p>This will create a JSON file, e.g. <code>task_results_20191218_081448_662435.json</code>, inside the <code>&lt;model_path&gt;</code> folder. Email this file to <a href="mailto:askforalfred@googlegroups.com">askforalfred@googlegroups.com</a>, preferrably through a storage link on a platform like Google Drive, Dropbox etc.</p>
            <h3>Rules</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Try to solve the ALFRED dataset: all submissions must be attempts to solve the ALFRED dataset.</li>
                <li>Do not exploit the metadata in test-scenes: you should solve the vision-language grounding problem without misusing the metadata from THOR. You are only allowed to use RGB and language instructions (goal & step-by-step) as input for your agents. You cannot use additional depth, mask, metadata info etc. from the simulator on Test Seen and Test Unseen scenes. However, during training you are allowed to use additional info for auxiliary losses etc.</li>
                <li>Answer the following questions: a. Did you use additional sensory information from THOR as input, eg: depth, segmentation masks, class masks, panoramic images etc. during test-time? If so, please report them. b. Did you use the alignments between step-by-step instructions and expert action-sequences for training or testing? (no by default; the instructions are serialized into a single sentence)</li>
                <li>Share who you are: you must provide a team name and affiliation.</li>
                <li>(Optional) Share how you solved it: if possible, share information about how the task was solved. Link an academic paper or code repository if public.</li>
                <li>Only submit your own work: you may evaluate any model on the validation set, but must only submit your own work for evaluation against the test set.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Example Models</h3>
            <p>We provide a <a href="https://github.com/askforalfred/alfred/tree/master/models#pre-trained-model">pre-trained Seq2Seq+PM (Both) model</a> described in the paper.</p>
            <h3>Submitting to the Leaderboard</h3>
            <p>Only one submission is allowed every <b>7 days</b>. All submissions will be made public. Please do not create anonymous emails for multiple submissions. Use the val set to iterate on your agent.</p>
            <h3>Getting Help</h3>
            <p>If you need any help, please email us at <a href="mailto:askforalfred@googlegroups.com">askforalfred@googlegroups.com</a> and say you're asking about leaderboard ALFRED. Please include a submission URL if you are asking about a specific submission.</p>
